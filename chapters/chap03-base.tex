\chapter{Instantiation of the cryptographic primitives}\label{chap:instantiation}

In this chapter, we start by instantiating the cryptographic building blocks used in previous sections to describe the \zeth~\dapscheme~design. Finally, we proceed by providing security proofs justifying that our instantiation complies with the security requirements listed in previous sections.

\input{./chapters/chap03-sec01.tex} % PRFs, COMM and CRHs (may need to be split if we decide to instantiate these with different functions)
\input{./chapters/chap03-sec02.tex} % MKHASH
\input{./chapters/chap03-sec03.tex} % Zeth statement after instantiation
\input{./chapters/chap03-sec04.tex} % OT-SIG
\input{./chapters/chap03-sec05.tex} % Encryption scheme
\input{./chapters/chap03-sec06.tex} % ZkSNARK
